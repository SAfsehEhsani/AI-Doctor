            1.  **Analyze Symptoms:** Briefly analyze the provided symptoms based on general knowledge.
            2.  **Potential Conditions:** List 2-3 possible general conditions that *might* be associated with these symptoms. Clearly state these are POSSIBILITIES, require professional evaluation, and are NOT diagnoses.
            3.  **Recommended Precautions:** Suggest general precautions the user could take (e.g., rest, hydration, hygiene, avoiding triggers if known).
            4.  **General Medicine Types (Over-the-Counter):** Mention general types of over-the-counter medications that *might* help alleviate *some* symptoms (e.g., 'pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for headache', 'antihistamines for suspected mild allergic reactions'). **DO NOT recommend specific prescription drugs or dosages.** Emphasize consulting a pharmacist or doctor before taking any medication.
            5.  **Crucial Disclaimer:** ALWAYS prominently include the following disclaimer: "This is AI-generated information and NOT a substitute for professional medical advice. Consult a doctor or qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment."

            **Output Format:** Use clear headings for each section (Potential Conditions, Precautions, General Medicine Types, Disclaimer). Ensure the disclaimer is highly visible.
